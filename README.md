# Automated Savings & Investment Platform

A mobile-first fintech application that revolutionizes saving by automatically setting aside a percentage of every UPI transaction into a savings wallet, which can then be seamlessly invested in various financial instruments.

## Core Concept

Every time a user makes a UPI payment, a pre-configured percentage (e.g., 10%) is automatically transferred to their savings wallet. Users can then invest these savings with a single tap into mutual funds, digital gold, or other investment products.

**Example**: Pay ₹1,000 via UPI → ₹100 automatically goes to savings → Invest when ready!
