3. Enables one-tap investment into vetted, low-risk financial products
4. Gamifies savings with goals, streaks, and milestones
5. Provides insights into spending, saving, and investment patterns

### Success Metrics (Year 1)

- **50,000** monthly active users
- **₹50 Crore** in total savings accumulated
- **₹25 Crore** in total investments made

## Business Model

### Revenue Streams

#### 1. Investment Commissions (Primary)
- **Source:** Mutual fund houses pay 0.25% - 1% trailing commission
- **Example:** User invests ₹10,000 → Annual commission ₹25-100
- **Projected:** ₹25 Cr invested in Year 1 → ₹6.25L - 25L revenue

#### 2. Interest on Float
- **Source:** Savings wallet balance earns interest
- **Example:** Average ₹5 Cr float at 4% = ₹20L/year interest
- **Share with Users:** 50-50 split or full retention (TBD based on regulations)

#### 3. Premium Subscription (Future)
- **Price:** ₹99-199/month or ₹999-1,999/year
- **Features:**
  - Higher investment limits
  - Advanced analytics
  - Tax optimization tools
  - Priority support
- **Target:** 5% conversion → 2,500 users × ₹1,200/year = ₹30L

#### 4. Referral Partnerships
- **Partners:** Insurance, loans, credit cards
- **Commission:** ₹200-1,000 per conversion
- **Volume:** 1,000 conversions/year = ₹5L-10L

#### 5. Advertisement (Minimal)
- **Type:** Non-intrusive, financial products only
- **Placement:** Explore section, insights
- **Revenue:** ₹1-2L/year (de-prioritized)

### Cost Structure

#### Fixed Costs (Monthly)
| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Team Salaries (7 members) | ₹15,00,000 |
| Cloud Infrastructure | ₹1,50,000 |
| Third-party Services | ₹1,00,000 |
| Office & Operations | ₹2,00,000 |
| **Total Fixed** | **₹19,50,000** |

#### Variable Costs (Per User)
| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Payment Gateway (2% × ₹5,000/month) | ₹100 |
| SMS (5 × ₹0.20) | ₹1 |
| Email | ₹0 (free tier) |
| KYC (one-time) | ₹50 |
| **Total Variable** | **₹151/user** |

### Unit Economics

**Assumptions:**
- Average user makes ₹5,000 in payments/month
- 15% save percentage = ₹750 saved/month
- 50% of savings invested = ₹375 invested/month = ₹4,500/year
- Investment commission: 0.5% = ₹22.50/user/year

**Conclusion:** Need aggregation at scale. 10,000 active investors = ₹2.25L/year from commissions alone.
