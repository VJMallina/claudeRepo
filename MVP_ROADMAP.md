- Minimum 80% test coverage
- Documentation for complex logic

### Git Workflow
- Feature branches from main
- Naming convention: feature/description, bugfix/description
- Pull requests with description & screenshots
- Squash merge to main
- Protected main branch

### API Design
- RESTful conventions
- Versioning (v1, v2)
- Consistent error responses
- Request/response validation
- Rate limiting

### Database
- Use migrations for schema changes
- Never modify production directly
- Regular backups
- Index optimization

### Security
- Never commit secrets (use environment variables)
- API authentication on all protected routes
- Input validation & sanitization
- SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
- XSS prevention

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Payment gateway issues** → Have backup gateway ready (e.g., Cashfree as backup to Razorpay)
- **App store rejection** → Follow guidelines strictly, have legal docs ready
- **Performance issues** → Load testing before launch, auto-scaling setup
- **Security breach** → Regular audits, bug bounty, incident response plan

### Business Risks
- **Low user adoption** → Strong marketing, referral program, launch offers
- **High churn** → Focus on UX, collect feedback, iterate quickly
- **Regulatory issues** → Legal consultation, compliance from day one
- **Competition** → Focus on USP (automated savings), faster iteration
